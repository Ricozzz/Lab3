This is a pong game

Read me   Pong game
After linked to the USB5V, you will see a ‘welcome’ screen. Then there are three square for you to pick. 
1v1 (there are two players playing the game, you can touch the screen to control the paddle. If the ball cannot be reached, the other player will get one point. The one who get 5 points wins and then there will be a flash on the screen and the buzzer is on. Then you will come back to the ‘welcome’ screen.)
1v PC (you can control a paddle on your side and the other side is PC. And the same as 1v1.)
1v PCG(this uses gravity to control the left paddle.)
